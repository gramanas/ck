* ck
*The Config Keeper*

* build it
** requirements
- clang (llvm) or gcc (gnu)
- cmake
- sqlite3-dev

** gcc
Edit the =CMakeLists.txt= file and change the =clang= to =gcc=

** make
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# clone the repo
> cd ~/code; git clone https://github.com/gramanas/ck
# make a build directory and enter it
> mkdir ~/ck_build; cd ~/ck_build;
# run cmake
> cmake ~/code/ck
# run make
> make
# run ck
> ./ck
#+END_SRC

* for devs
** make
Just build with address sanitizer enabled like so:
llvm has better asan than gcc, so I use that.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# clone the repo
> cd ~/code; git clone https://github.com/gramanas/ck
# make a build directory and enter it
> mkdir ~/ck_build; cd ~/ck_build;
# run cmake
> cmake ~/code/ck -DCK_ASAN=ON
# run make
> make
# run ck
> ./ck
#+END_SRC

** tests
The testing "suite" is just a bash script
that executs all the bash scripts under
=tests/=

*** run tests
Simply go to the build dir and type.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./check_ck
#+END_SRC
