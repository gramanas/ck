ck is currently in pre-alpha version, meaning barely usable and unsafe to use
without a backup of your configs.

ck is a C utility that aids with the config file management.
It's a direct result of laziness.

It basically moves a config file to a special directory
and then links it to the place it should be.
Later you can sync this directory with whatever way fits you.

It also provides an convenient way to quickly edit any config file
indexed by it.
